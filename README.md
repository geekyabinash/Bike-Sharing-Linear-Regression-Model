## General Information
- This project focuses on predicting the demand for bike-sharing services provided by BoomBikes in the US.
- **Background**: BoomBikes has faced revenue declines due to the COVID-19 pandemic. They seek to understand the factors affecting bike demand to prepare a business strategy post-pandemic.

- **Dataset**: The dataset includes daily records of bike rentals along with various features such as weather conditions, season, holiday, and weekday information. It is based on historical data of bike rentals.

## Conclusions
- **Conclusion 1**: Temperature and feeling temperature are positively correlated with bike demand, indicating higher rentals on warmer days.
- **Conclusion 2**: Clear weather conditions significantly increase bike rentals, while adverse weather conditions reduce them.
- **Conclusion 3**: There is a noticeable increase in bike rentals in 2019 compared to 2018, showing growing popularity.
- **Conclusion 4**: Bike rentals are higher on weekends and non-working days compared to weekdays and working days.
